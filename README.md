# Learn Basic C# Programming
This repo has some programs for practising c# coding

Assignment 1:

 

Create a VisualStudio solution that contains at least the following projects:

    Executable called “Runner”. It will ask the user which of the problems below to solve.
    A library called “SumOfMultiple” containing a solution for the following problem:
        Find the sum of all natural numbers that are a multiple of 3 or 5 below a limit provided as input.
    A library called “SequenceAnalysis” containing a solution for the following problem:
        Find the uppercase words in a string, provided as input, and order all characters in these words alphabetically.
        Input: "This IS a STRING"
        Output: "GIINRSST"

 

Assignment 2:

 

Write a method:

 

    public int IsXDivisibleByY(int X, int Y) { .. }

 

That meets the following conditions:

1. Method returns 1, if X can be divided by Y without a remainder.
2. Method returns 0, if X can't be divided by Y without a remainder.
3. Solution MUSN'T include any conditional checks (if condition, .Equals call, the ternary and null-coalescing operators, etc...).
4. Solution MUSN'T include any exception handling (try-catch-finally)
5. It must be taken into account that both parameters could be given all range of the parameter type.
